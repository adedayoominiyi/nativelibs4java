[JavaCL](http://javacl.googlecode.com) has migrated to its own repository: [ochafik/JavaCL](http://github.com/ochafik/JavaCL).

Note: The legacy JNA version is in the JNA branch, but it is not supported anymore and its last release was 1.0.0-RC3. Please [migrate to the BridJ version](https://code.google.com/p/javacl/wiki/MigratingFromJNAToBridJ).

Please [file issues there](http://github.com/ochafik/JavaCL/issues).
